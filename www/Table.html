      <div class="modal-body">France and Denmark emphatically ended a streak of 36 matches without a goalless draw at Russia 2018. Their 90-minute standoff in Moscow took both sides through to the last-16 but it represented something of a nadir for this World Cup, with France somehow managing to double down on their slow, turgid opening to the tournament. The game also posed further selection questions for Didier Deschamps as he attempts to wrestle some form from his supremely talented yet cripplingly uninspired squad. Most notably: what should he do with Nabil Fékir, the only player who posed a consistent threat against Denmark.</div>

      <div class="modal-body">Despite winning all their qualifying matches and the Confederations Cup the previous year, Germany started their 2018 World Cup campaign on a sour note when they lost to Mexico for the first time in World Cup history. This was their first loss in a group stage match since the 2010 World Cup and their first loss in an opener since the 1982 World Cup. Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 in their second game via an injury time winner from Toni Kroos, but was subsequently eliminated by South Korea following a 2–0 loss, their first first round exit since 1938 and first ever in group stage. Germany had 28 shots with 6 on target, but the South Korean defense, led by keeper Cho Hyun-woo, did not concede once.</div>
